If yes from whom opponent and to what amount ? Nos1 and 2 jointly and severally Rs1733621­ 3 What order and Award ? As per final order REASONS As to issue No1 9­ In support of his contentions the applicant deposed below Exh 23 He deposed as to how accident took place He is injured and victim He is an eye witness It has come on record that the offending tempo dashed to the injured when he was going on his motorcycle The offending vehicle came from opposite direction very speedily It was being driven by its driver without taking any caution It gave dash to motorcycle and he sustained multiple injuries The Final Charge­sheet (Exh 24) shows that after investigation police found that the driver of offending vehicle was driving tempo in a rash and negligent manner and while trying to overtake another vehicle it dashed to the motorcycle of applicant 10­ During cross­examination it is brought on record that accident took place in the middle of the road On the basis of this admission it is argued that the case is of contributory negligence It is admitted fact that the accident took place in the middle of road However that does not necessarily mean that the applicant contributed towards the\nCNR No 6 MACP No 5762018 MHPU01­013535­2018 Judgment accident The spot panchanama clearly shows as to how the offending vehicle crossed centre of road and came towards the right side of the road causing accident accident It reveals that the road near the spot of accident is 18 ft wide The spot of accident is 8 ft away from the right side of the road If the centre of road is considered as 9 ft still the offending vehicle went 1 ft away from the centre of road and caused accident This must be the reason the police after due investigation registered an offence against the driver of offending tempo The offending tempo not only dashed to the motorcycle of injured but the driver also flee away from the spot of the accident without caring to help the injured All these facts are sufficient enough to hold that the driver was rash and negligent and accident took place due to his mistake 11­ As far as injuries are concerned medical evidence on record shows that applicant sustained head injury as well as various grievous injuries The police after investigation found driver of tempo negligent and therefore offence is also registered against him The evidence on record thus shows that accident took place due to rash and negligent act of the tempo driver I therefore hold that applicant proves that he has suffered permanent disability due to accidental injuries sustained in a motor vehicular accident occurred on 05102017 at about 715 am on\nCNR No 7 MACP No 5762018 MHPU01­013535­2018 Judgment Shirur Rajgurunagar road village Ramling­Shirur Near K M Market 1106 District Pune due to rash and negligent driving of the Tata LPT 909 Truck bearing No MH­19­Z­4096 Hence I answer Issue No1 in the affirmative As to issue No 2 :­ Entitlement of compensation :­ 12­ Admittedly at the time of accident the injured who was driving motorcycle was below 18 years His date of birth as per School Identity card is 21082000 As such his age on the day of accident was 17 years 2 months and 16 days Harping on this fact it is argued on behalf of insurance company that the injured was minor and not having valid driving licnece at the time of accident As such he is not entitled for any compensation 13­ While dealing with this aspect it is necessary to refer Full Bench Judgment of The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Saraswati Palariya and Others Vs New India Assurance Company Limited and others 2019 ACJ 42 In the case law cited supra Hon'ble Supreme Court held that contributory negligence on the ground that the deceased was driving the vehicle without a driving licence is unsustainable Driving without a valid driving licence may expose the claimants to other liabilities but no inference of contributory negligence can be arrived at on that basis In the case at hand also  \nCNR No 8 MACP No 5762018 MHPU01­013535­2018 Judgment same principle would apply Now what remains to be decided is quantum of just compensation Quantum 14­ As this is an injury claim the applicant would be entitled for compensation under various heads Those are hereinafter discussed separately for the sake of brevity (a) Hospitalization and Medical expenses : The applicant has specifically deposed that after the accident he took treatment in three different hospitals The prolonged treatment was going on for almost two years He was treated as indoor patient for 55 days He had undergone various surgeries including fixation and removal of implants He also suffered facial disfigurement of forehead over the right eyebrow The applicant has furnished all the original bills along with list of consolidated bills at Exh 39 As far as bills of transportation are concerned they are not considered here as they would be considered in the separate head Excluding the transportation bills of Rs46900­ according to applicant he incurred expenses of Rs1594265­ However in the written arguments the opponent No 2 brought on record certain mistakes done by the applicant during computation of bills at Exh 39 In any case the opponent agreed that excluding the transportation bills the expenses incurred for\nCNR No 9 MACP No 5762018 MHPU01­013535­2018 Judgment treatment are of Rs 1388621­(rounded up) The applicant has furnished all the original bills to that effect and thus applicant is entitled for Rs 1388621­ under this head (b) Pain and sufferings :­ Admittedly due to accident applicant was treated as indoor patient in in Sahyadri Hospital from 05102017 to 01112017 He was also admitted in Sainath Hospital from 20122017 to 13012018 and from 19112019 to 21112019 Approximately the entire period of treatment was two years and he was indoor patient for almost 55 days Unfortunately due to accidental injury his right leg is shortened The injuries must have caused tremendous pain and agony to the applicant In such situation he is entitled for Rs50000­ towards pain and sufferings (c) Conveyance:­ The injured was in hospital for 55 days and during this period some one from his family must have visited to hospital every day to look after him So also the injured had to visit hospital after discharge for follow­up treatment In such situation he is entitled for an amount of Rs 25000­ under this head As far as bills of transportation produced by the applicant are concerned no any person from the said travelling agency is examined to prove those bills So also the\nCNR No 10 MACP No 5762018 MHPU01­013535­2018 Judgment criteria of original bills applied to the medical hospital bills cannot be applied to the so called transportation bills Thus applicant is not entitled for the entire amount shown under the bills of transportation (d) Nursing and Personal Attendance : The applicant already sought entire bill of hospitalization and thus it is not necessary to consider nursing charges separately However it is required to keep in mind that during hospitalization his family members or one of the relatives must have accompanied him Thus injured is entitled for Rs10000­ under the head of personal attendance (e) Special Diet :­ The span of treatment and injuries sustained by the applicant must have required him to take restricted and special diet Needless to say such diet is required for early recovery of the patient Therefore applicant is entitled for Rs25000­ towards special diet (f) Loss of enjoyment of life and dis­comfort in life:­ Due to accident applicant sustained permanent disfigurement of face During the course of recording of evidence this fact is observed stating that the injured sustained disfigurement of face at forehead over the right eyebrow It has also come in the evidence of medical witness\nCNR No 11 MACP No 5762018 MHPU01­013535­2018 Judgment that due to surgeries after accident the right leg of applicant is shortened Therefore he is limping while walking The applicant is only 19 years old He will have to suffer this facial disfigurement and permanent disability of leg till his last breath The routine life of a young boy of 19 years age due to shortened limb and facial disfigurement would be miserable and a nightmare As such applicant is entitled for Rs75000­ towards Loss of enjoyment of life and dis­ comfort in life (g) Permanent disability Admittedly there is permanent disfigurement of face and unfortunately this fact is not brought on record during the evidence of medical witness However the same is recorded by the Court itself at the time of recording of evidence As far as permanent disability is concerned the applicant has examined AW2 Dr Rahul Shivaji Keskar Orthopedic Surgeon of Sainath Hospital at Exh33 He has produced and proved permanent disability certificate (Exh36) The permanent disability certificate shows that applicant sustained 25 permanent disability In the cross­examination an attempt is made to show that permanent disability is assessed at higher end However despite mere contention nothing is brought on\nCNR No 12 MACP No 5762018 MHPU01­013535­2018 Judgment record to justify the same On the contrary it has come on record that despite removal of implant the injured is neither completely cured nor disability is fully reduced As already discussed along with shortening of one of the limb the applicant is also suffering from permanent disfigurement of face The accidental injury has reduced capacity of right limb and normal functioning The limping walk and facial disfigurment would be the fate of injured through out his life As such the permanent disability of 25 appears to be rational and appropriate In such situation the applicant is entitled for Rs 25000­ for compensation under this head (h) Loss of future prospects : The injured was student at the time of accident Now also he is taking education As such for the computation purpose if his income would be considered as Rs30000­ per annum it shall suffice the purpose The multiplier of 18 would be applicable looking to the age of injured Thus looking to 25 of disability the entitlement would be Rs 30000­ X 18 X 25= Rs 135000­ 16­ The tabular form showing entitlement of compensation under different heads is as follows\nCNR No 13 MACP No 5762018 MHPU01­013535­2018 Judgment Sr No Particulars Amount(Rs) (a) Hospitalization and medical expenses 1388621­ (b) Pain and sufferings 50000­ (c) Conveyance 25000­ (d) Nursing and personal attendance 10000­ (e) Special Diet 25000­ (f) Loss of enjoyment and dis­comfort in life 75000­ (g) Permanent disability 25000­ (h) Loss of Future prospects 135000­ Total Amount Rs : 1733621­ Interest : 17­ As far as rate of interest is concerned looking to the prevailing rate of interest of bank and as per judgment of Apex court applicants would be entitled for interest at the rate of 9 pa from the date of application till its actual realisation Who shall pay : 18­ Admittedly neither opponent No1 nor opponent No2 adduced any evidence The opponent No1 is the owner of offending vehicle The opponent No2 is its insurer As such opponent Nos 1 and 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation I therefore answer Issue No 2 accordingly 19­ In sequel I pass following order\nCNR No 14 MACP No 5762018 MHPU01­013535­2018 Judgment ORDER 1­ The application is partly allowed with proportionate costs 2­ Opponent Nos 1 and 2 are directed to pay jointly and severally compensation of Rs1733621­ (Rupees Seventeen Lakhs Thirty Three Thousand Six Hundred and Twenty One only) including interim compensation awarded under section 140 of the Motor Vehicles Act to the applicant 3­ Out of Rs1733621­ an amount of Rs 500000­ be kept in Fixed Deposit Receipt for the period of Five years in the name of applicant in any nationalised bank of his choice and rest of the amount be paid to him by issuing account payee cheque on due verification 4­ Opponent Nos 1 and 2 shall pay compensation amount along with interest at the rate of 9 per
